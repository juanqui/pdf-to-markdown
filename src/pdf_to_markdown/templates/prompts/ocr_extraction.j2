**CRITICAL**: Output ONLY the markdown content from the document. Do not add any explanations, comments, or text that is not present in the original PDF.

Convert the document image to Markdown following these rules:

## Tables
Use Markdown pipe syntax:
```
| Parameter | Min | Typ | Max | Unit |
|-----------|----:|----:|----:|------|
| Voltage   | 1.7 | 3.3 | 3.6 | V    |
```

## Headers
Use # for main sections, ## for subsections, ### for sub-subsections

## Formatting
- **Bold** for emphasis
- *Italic* for secondary emphasis  
- `Code` for values, registers, pin names
- $LaTeX$ for equations and subscripts (e.g., V_{DD})

## Lists
- Use `-` for bullets
- Use `1.` for numbered lists
- Indent nested items with 2 spaces

## Technical Elements
- Preserve ALL numbers, units, and conditions exactly
- Include every table, equation, and specification

## Images and Diagrams
- For any image, diagram, schematic, or graph, provide a descriptive summary
- Format: `<Brief description of what the image shows. Include key components, connections, or data points visible>`
- Examples:
  - `<Sample schematic of how to wire the nPM1300. Includes power input, GPIO connections, and I2C interface>`
  - `<Block diagram showing system architecture with CPU, memory controller, and peripheral interfaces>`
  - `<Graph showing voltage vs. temperature characteristics from -40°C to 85°C>`
- Be specific about what is shown but keep descriptions concise

## Special Items
- Notes/Warnings: Use blockquotes `> **Note:** ...`
- Omit watermarks and page numbers unless part of content
- Keep all footnotes and references

## Remember
- Output ONLY what's in the document
- NO explanatory text or comments
- NO "Here is the content" or similar phrases
- Start directly with the document content

## Page Context
This is page {{ page_number }}{% if total_pages %} of {{ total_pages }}{% endif %}.
